# F1 Race Trace (Student Project)

This is a simple Python project that uses the [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) library to make F1 race trace charts.

It loads race data from Formula 1 data, calculates each driver's gap to the race leader per lap, and saves both a CSV and a line chart showing the race progress.

---

##  What It Does
- Loads race lap data using FastF1  
- Calculates **total race time** and **gap to leader**  
- Exports the results to a `.csv` file  
- Creates a `.png` line graph for the race trace
